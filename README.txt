The files found in this repository are part of a master project for benchmarking the LTSmin tool.
It mainly consists of scripts for generating and analyzing testcases. The scripts are probably too
specific for any use outside the testing environment. So if you do not know the author of this
repository, you should refrain from using or changing this repository.
