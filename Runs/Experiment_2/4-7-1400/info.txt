This run aims at collecting the properties of petrinets after the regrouping phase.
Specifically the following properties are needed:

Regroup
- bandwidth
- profile
- span
- average wavefront
- RMS wavefront

Because regrouping is deterministic only 2 runs are performed per testcase. To increase the likelyhood
of encountering this information at least once per model, different order and sat-granularity from experiment
1 are uses to define different testcases per model. Since there were 4 different orders and 7 different
sat-granularities for experiment 1 (before 7th of April) there are 28 testcases per model. This makes 56 runs
per model.

Since the sylvan stats are not needed, there is no distinction between performance and statistic testcases.
So the statistics runs are omitted.

Note that ltsmin2csv.sh assumes that the sat-granularity is fixed for a testsuite. Thus the sat-granularities 
are incorrect in the parsed result. Since the different sat-granularities were only used for generating the 
different test cases, there is no problem. The results will be compressed to model X order -> stats. If
the correct sat-granularities are needed, the output of this suite should be 'reparsed' with a revision of
ltsmin2csv.sh.
