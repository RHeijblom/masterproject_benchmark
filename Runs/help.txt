Format of folder: <month>-<day>-<hour><minute>
So 1-2-0304 means the run started 2nd of January around 4 minutes past 3 AM

All experiments are performed in 2016, so the year is omitted in the folder name

Experiment 1: sat-like, sat-granularity={1,5,10,20,30,40,max-int}, save-sat-levels, next-union performed on 'old' version of LTSmin
Experiment 2: single run with all different sat-granularities from experiment 1 to determine statistics and discover incorrect output.

Everthing below is performed with the 'new' version of LTSmin

Experiment 3: sat-like, sat-granularity={1,5,10,20,40,80,max-int}, save-sat-levels
Experiment 4: sat-loop, sat-granularity={1,5,10,20,40,80,max-int}, save-sat-levels
Experiment 5: none (no saturation)

Same as experiment 3-5 without save-sat-levels

Experiment 6: sat-like, sat-granularity={1,5,10,20,40,80,max-int}
