Addition of Experiment 1;
Also consider extreme cases.

* order=chain sat-granularity=2147483647
* order=chain-prev sat-granularity=2147483647
* order=bfs sat-granularity=2147483647
* order=bfs-prev sat-granularity=2147483647

2147483647 = 2^31-1 (MAX INT) which forces to overflow statevector size; thus sat-granularity > statevector size
