Addition of Experiment 1;
Also consider extreme cases.

* order=chain sat-granularity=2147483647
* order=chain-prev sat-granularity=2147483647
* order=bfs sat-granularity=2147483647
* order=bfs-prev sat-granularity=2147483647

2147483647 = 2^31-1 (MAX INT) which forces to overflow statevector size; thus sat-granularity > statevector size

WARNING ERRORNEOUS RUN:
missing 1 srun command; missing one performance run of eratosthenes-020.pnml with --order=chain. 
Probably boost perm order, but nevertheless incomplete.
