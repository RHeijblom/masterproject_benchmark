Relative margin = 0%
Threshold = 50%

When a result of metric falls with the relative margin of the absolute best of that specific metric is considered
the best result for that model. For example best solving time is 100 sec for a model. All techniques which have a 
solving time of less than 105 sec are considered the best technique for solving that specific model.

Threshold indicates which percentage of all models of a technique needs to be solved in order to be considered as
a suitable candidate.
