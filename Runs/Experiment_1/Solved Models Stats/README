This directory contains the performance of the techniques wrt the number of solved models.

Without considering the statistics runs there are 10 runs per technique (combination of order and sat-granularity)
However due to 'incorrect' granularities in the base data, this may change to any multiple of 10.

A model is solvable by technique X if X has succesfully solved the model at least 5 out of 10 times, thus 50%.

The above is assummed for all files results except 'Solved Overview Total' which individualy counts the testruns.
The number of testcases per granularity isn't fixed due to the value of state_vector_length. When granularity is
larger than state_vector_length, the testcase is moved to max. This explains the spike at max.
