This directory contains the performance of the techniques wrt the number of solved models.

Without considering the statistics runs there are 10 runs per technique (combination of order and sat-granularity)

A model is solvable by technique X if X has succesfully solved the model at least 5 out of 10 times.
The above is assummed for all files results except 'Solved Overview Total' which individualy counts the testruns.
