Errorlist (based on experiment 2 run 1)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Angiogenesis 15 : statespace differs from MCC (small amount)
BridgeAndVehicles-V04-P05-N02 : statespace differs from MCC (factor 3.7 larger)
BridgeAndVehicles-V10-P10-N10 : statespace differs from MCC (factor 6.8 larger)
BridgeAndVehicles-V20-P10-N10 : statespace differs from MCC (factor 8.7 larger)
Circular train : when sat-granularity=1 statespace is erroneously 2 (for all 4 different orders and 7 instances). Other properties are also marginally smaller.
Closed system : when sat-granularity=1 statespace is erroneously 2 (for all 4 different orders and 5 instances). Other properties are also marginally smaller.
CS Repetitions 3 : statespace differs from MCC (small amount; 1.3407E8 instead of 1.3408E8)
Database (Mutex) 2,4,10,20 : when sat-granularity=1 statespace is erroneously 2 or 4 (for all 4 different orders). Other properties are also marginally smaller.
Drink Vending Machine / Distributeur 2 : statespace differs from MCC (factor 4 larger; 4096 instead of 1024)
Echo : when sat-granularity=1 statespace is assumed wrong 3 or 4 (for all 4 different orders and 9 instances). Other properties are also marginally smaller. No info availble from MCC.
