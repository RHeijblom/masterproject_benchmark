Some models perform equally as best despite the tiebreaker. The last tiebreaker is based on the total number of BDD operations (less is better), but cannot be extracted from performanceOverview.csv at the moment. Using strangeFilter.r the following models were selected as best option:

TIME:

fischer.1 			- chain-prev 	sat-like   40
Philosophers-10 	- chain-prev 	sat-like 	5
phils.2 			- chain-prev 	sat-like 	1
RAS-R-2 			- chain 		none

PEAKSIZE:

cyclic_scheduler.2 	- chain-prev 	none
Philosophers-10 	- chain-prev 	sat-like 	5
phils.2 			- chain-prev 	sat-like 	1
phils.3 			- chain 		sat-like 	5
protocols.4 		- chain-prev 	sat-loop   80  (note, even BBD operations were equal, so performance of statisticsrun was the tiebreaker)
RAS-R-10 			- chain 		sat-like   20
RAS-R-2 			- chain 		none
